              <h3>Abstract</h3>
              <p>To do.</p>
              <h3>Introduction</h3>
              <p>The dynamics of behaviors in a population is a complex process. Nevertheless, we can
                  attempt to formalize it with mathematical and computational models.
                  <br/><br/>
                  The goal of the model here is to formalize complex contagion dynamics on social networks.
                  A complex contagion is a contagion of a behavior where a susceptible individual needs to be
                  exposed to a behavior multiple times - rather than just once, as in simple contagion - before the individual
                  adopts the behavior. There is an increasingly large body of evidence indicating that behavioral
                  spread follows the logic of complex contagion.
                  <br/><br/>
                  Previous models of complex contagion have assumed that a new behavior spreads in the population,
                  but that the resident behavior does not spread. Such models are rooted in epidemiological models
                  where a infectious agent can be transmitted from host to host, but transmission always occurs in a
                  single direction: the infectious state is contagious, but the susceptible state is not. Behaviors,
                  however, often do not fall into this category. Behaviors can be adopted because they are communicated
                  by others through peer influence or observational learning, but there is no a priori reason to assume that
                  only a novel behavior is socially contagious. There might be cases where
                  such a simplifying assumption is justified, and the model proposed here allows to capture these cases as well.
                  <br/><br/>I will be using a population memetics approach where by meme I mean any culture entity that
                  can be stably transmitted from person to person.
              </p>
              <h3>Methods</h3>
              <p>
                  The basis of the model is a network where individuals are represented by nodes and connected through
                  ties along which memes can be transmitted. Any network structure can be modeled, but I will focus
                  here on a random network as a canonical network null model, as well as a small world network as a
                  canonical social network null model.
                  <br/><br>
                  It is worth revisiting the implicit and explicit assumptions of previous models of complex contagion.
                  Previous models of complex contagion - from now on referred to as the <i>standard model</i> - assume
                  that an individual with resident behavior M0 will maintain behavior M0 until exposed to the new,
                  spreading behavior M1, at least T times (with the requirement that T > 1 as per the definition of
                  complex contagion). Further, transmission can only occur from phenotype M1, but not from phenotype M0:
                  when exposed, transmission occurs at rate β (equivalent to the transmission rate in infectious disease
                  models) in the direction M1 to M0 only. The latter assumption is common to all epidemiological models
                  in that an infectious unit can be transmitted from the infectious individual to susceptible
                  individuals, and eventually turn susceptible individuals into infectious individuals, but the reverse
                  direction is never possible. (Infectious individuals may go back to a susceptible state by recovery,
                  but the susceptible state is never transmissible: recovery occurs independently - and even in the
                  absence - of other individuals.)
                  <br/><br/>
                  This standard model, based on epidemiological models, is able to capture a number of social contagion
                  phenomena. I propose a population memetics model that can easily capture the standard model, but is
                  more general and has its roots in both epidemiology and population genetics. In particular, I suggest
                  to model individuals as defined by a set of memes - cultural units that are transmissible. The set of
                  memes is called the memotype - in analogy to the genotype - and the expressed behavior is called
                  phenotype. The model has three requirements:
                  <br/><br/>
                  <ol>
                  <li>The memotype - phenotype map must be defined explicitly.</li>
                  <li>Transmission rates - a measure of reproductive fitness - must be defined for all phenotypes
                      (by requirement 1, they are then also defined per memotype).</li>
                  <li>The rules of horizontal inheritance must be defined explicitly; that is, for each
                      memotype exposed to another memotype by transmission, the resulting
                      memotype (distribution) must be defined.</li>
                  </ol>

                  In order to develop the general population memetics model, I will start with the well-studied standard
                model of a binary trait (the behavior can be either M0 or M1), and the simplest form of complex
                contagion (T=2). We begin by defining the resident memotype to be 00, the singularly exposed memotype
                to be 01, and the doubly exposed memotype to be 11. The first requirement of the model is to make the
                memotype - phenotype map explicit, which in this case is as follows:
                  <br/><br/>
                  Memotype 00 <i class="icon-arrow-right"></i> Phenotype M0<br/>
                  Memotype 01 <i class="icon-arrow-right"></i> Phenotype M0<br/>
                  Memotype 11 <i class="icon-arrow-right"></i> Phenotype M1<br/>
                  <br/><br/>
                  This model thus makes the assumption that both non-exposed (memotype 00) and singularly exposed
                (memotype 01) individuals have the same behavior (phenotype M0).
                  <br/><br/>
                  Next, the transmission rates need to be defined explicitly. Following the standard model of complex contagion with T = 0, the transmission rates are as follows:
                  <br/><br/>
                  Transmission rate for phenotype M0 : &beta;   <br/>
                  Transmission rate for phenotype M0 : 0
                  <br/><br/>
                  Finally, the rules of horizontal inheritance must be defined explicitly. In the case of the standard model, the rules are as follows:

                          Exposed memotype
                          00	01	11
                  Transmitting memotype	00	00*	01*	11*
                  01	00*	01*	11*
                  11	01	11	11
                  * in principle these values are irrelevant in the standard model as the transmission rate from memotypes 00 an 01 (i.e. phenotype M0) is always 0.


                  These three definitions (the memotype - phenotype map, the transmission rates, and the rules of horizontal transmission) are sufficient to define a population memetics version of the standard model.
                  The definition of three memotypes as sets of two memes of two different types (0 and 1) needs justification. As an alternative, one could have defined the three memotypes to be sets of a single meme of three different types (0, 1 and 2), and still be able to fulfill all the requirements set above. To see why this latter approach would be problematic, it is worth revisiting what a meme is meant to be. A meme is a cultural unit that can be stably transmitted from person to person (barring mutation which I will ignore here). This definition requires that when a meme is transmitted to a person, the resident meme will either be replaced, or complemented, but no new meme can be created. If we were to define memotypes to be sets of a single meme of three different types (0, 1 and 2), where only meme 2 can be transmitted, this assumption would be violated. Consider the case of meme 2 being transmitted to a person with meme 0 (i.e not previously exposed). Since the person is now exposed once (meme 1), the transmission of meme 2 to meme 0 would have resulted in a new meme 1, which is not possible. The original definition of three memotypes as sets of two memes of two different types (0 and 1) does not suffer from this problem. Consider again the case where memotype 00 is exposed to memotype 11. Meme 1 is transmitted from memotype 11 to a person with memotype 00 (i.e. two memes 0). The resulting memotype 01 is simply a combination of memes 0 and 1, no new memes have been created. What has been created instead is a new memotype.
